# JOB_SEARCHER_USING_LANGCHAIN
This code uses Langchain to create a system that suggests relevant technical positions based on a user's description of their skills and interests. It then uses SerpAPI to find job openings for the suggested position in a city specified by the user.

To use the code, you will need to have an OpenAI API key and a SerpAPI API key, which you will need to set as environment variables.

You can then run the code and enter your description when prompted. The code will then suggest a relevant technical position and ask you to enter a city. It will then search for job openings for that position in the specified city and print the results.
